			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<hr />
			<p><img class="profile-pic" src="assets/images/jacob-profile.jpg" />I'm a 36-year old immigrant and a computer scientist. While I have a deep knowledge of Java, C and C++, web development is my current area of focus. I have utilized numerous web-based languages and tools including: HTML, CSS, jQuery, Javascript, PHP, Perl, MySQL, Bootstrap, Foundation, WordPress, Joomla, dotCMS and Weebly.</p>
			<p>for 15 years after graduating from the University of Houston with a Bachelors in Computer Science I ran an online-business which required me to create and maintain my site while also manage the day-to-day business. I recently closed my business down in order to pursue a full-time career as a full-stack web developer as it provides me an unrelenting source of intellectual and artistic fulfillment.</p>
			<p>Please look at my work by clicking on the 'Portfolio' link and contact me should you have any enquiries.</p>
